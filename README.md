# SuperHeroes

This is a simple list and search Marvel Heroes app using the public

## Project architecture

The architecture chosen to this project was the MVP.

Model–view–presenter (MVP) is a derivation of the model–view–controller (MVC) architectural pattern 
which mostly used for building user interfaces. In MVP, the presenter assumes the functionality of 
the “middle-man”. In MVP, all presentation logic is pushed to the presenter. 
MVP advocates separating business and persistence logic out of the Activity and Fragment

## Versioning

The versioning scheme follows `major.minor.commit_count`. Major and minor numbers are 
increased manually. Commit count is extracted from the number of commits present in 
the `master` branch. Run this task to check the latest version `./gradlew version`.

## Dependency Injection

[Dagger](https://google.github.io/dagger/) is the tool who help us here. It is a fully static, compile-time 
dependency injection framework for both Java and Android.
